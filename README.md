# WeGive
WeGive is a mobile app designed to connect individuals who are willing to volunteer their time and services with senior citizens and holocaust survivors in their local community. The app's primary goal is to help alleviate the daily struggles of elderly individuals by providing them with much-needed assistance and companionship.
